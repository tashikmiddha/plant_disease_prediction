🌿 Plant Disease Prediction Website
This project is a Deep Learning-based web application for accurately predicting plant diseases through uploaded images. Users can simply upload an image of a plant leaf, and the system will identify and classify the disease using a trained deep learning model.

Project developed under AWaDH Lab, sponsored by IIT Ropar.

🚀 Features
📸 Image Upload Interface – Upload a plant leaf image directly from your device.

🧠 Deep Learning Model – Trained using state-of-the-art CNN architectures for plant disease classification.

⚡ Real-time Predictions – Get instant disease diagnosis with probability scores.

🌱 User-Friendly UI – Clean, responsive, and intuitive design for all users.

🧪 Research-Grade – Suitable for agricultural diagnostics and academic research.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Bootstrap/React - if applicable)

Backend: Flask / Django (depending on your implementation)

Model: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using TensorFlow / PyTorch

Deployment: (e.g., Heroku, AWS, PythonAnywhere – update based on your deployment)

🧪 Model Training
Trained on a curated dataset of plant leaf images.

Preprocessing: Image resizing, normalization, data augmentation.

Architecture: Custom CNN / Transfer learning (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet, etc.)

Accuracy: ~XX% (update with your model’s performance)
